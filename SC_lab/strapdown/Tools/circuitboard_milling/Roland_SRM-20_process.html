    <h1>Cutting Circuitboards on the Roland SRM-20 - basic process</h1>
    <section>


      <p><b>Run modserver (if it is not running already).</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>On the Windows Desktop, double-click the shortcut "start mods"</li>

          <li>A command window will appear, with the text
            "listening for connection from client address 127.0.0.1 on server port 1234"</li>
        </ol>




      <p><b>Open fab mods.</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the webpage on the desktop to run the local mods program:  "PCB_Harvard_SRM20"</li>
          <li>You should see "socket opened" in the WebSocket device window.</li>
          <li>Machine should respond to the "move to origin" and "move to home" keys.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>Place a circuitboard blank on the sacrificial layer.</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Clean both circuitboard back and sac. layer.</li>
          <li>Cover the back of the blank double-stick tape, no overlaps or creases.</li>
        </ol>

      <p><b>Insert the tool and zero it.</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Hit "move to home" to bring spindle up. </li>
          <li>Put 1/64" bit in collet (insert high - almost all the shaft in the collet)  </li>
          <li>Hit "move to origin".  Adjust x,y,and z to as needed.   </li>
          <li>Loosen the toolbit screw, let the tool rest on the board and then tighten its screw.</li>
        </ol>



        <p><b>Run traces file. </b></p>
          <ol>
          <li>Select png file for traces.</li>
          <li>Select defaults for traces.</li>
          <li>Calculate.</li>
          <li>Send file to device.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>Run outline file. </b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Change to 1/32" bit.  Leave bit high in collet so that it does not crash into bed when zeroing.</li>
        <li>Go to the origin.  As before, move the tool to the board surface to set the z-zero.</li>
        <li>Select defaults for outline</li>
        <li>Calculate</li>
        <li>Send file to device.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><b>When the machine finishes running, wait ~5 seconds before opening shield.  If you open too soon, communication is lost.
       In that case, turn off SRM20 and turn it on again.  Communication should re-establish.</b></p>
