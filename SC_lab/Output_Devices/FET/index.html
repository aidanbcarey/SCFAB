###FET (Field Effect Transistor)

An FET is useful when you need to control a current larger than ~40 mA (0.040 Amperes) with a microcontroller.

  - The microcontroller pin is attached to the gate of the transistor.  When the gate voltage is above about 2 Volts relative to ground, the transistor
counducts current.  When the gate voltage is lower than that, the transistor blocks the flow of current, and can withstand a large power supply voltage.
It requires almost no current from the pin attached to the gate to control a large current flowing from
drain to source of the FET.

  - The load can be turned off and on just by switching the pin at the gate between LOW and HIGH.  The load, for instance
  a motor, can usually be controlled betwen full 'on' and full 'off' by using pulse width modulation (PWM).  In the Arduino
  code, this is done with the function analogWrite().  See the Arduino reference for details.

  - The current can be provided by:
    - The 5V power pin on the Arduino board - not good for more than 100 - few 100 mA.
    - An external power supply, accessed through the "vin" pin of the Arduino - still only good for ~ 1 Ampere.
    - An external power supply, with positive lead going directly to the FET drain.  Now you are limited only by the
      capabilities of the FET!

- The FET that we have in stock, P55NF06L, can conduct up to 55 amps in the "on" state, and in the "off" state can withstand
up to 60 Volts.  Note that many FETs require more than  2-3 Volts on the gate to turn on - this one is well-suited to the low
voltage applications that we have.

- Pictured here is an n-type MOSFET (Metal oxide - silicon Field Effect Transistor).  They also come in p-type,  which turn on when the gate is at a lower
voltage than the source.
