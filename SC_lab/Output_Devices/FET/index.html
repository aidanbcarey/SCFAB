An FET is useful when you need to control a current larger than ~20 mA (0.020 Amperes) with a microcontroller.

  - The microcontroller pin is attached to the gate of the transistor.  When the gate voltage is above about 2 Volts relative to ground, the transistor
counducts current.  When the gate voltage is lower than that, the transistor blocks the flow of current, and can withstand a large power supply voltage.
It requires almost no current from the pin attached to the gate to control a large current flowing from
drain to source of the FET.

  - The load can be turned off and on just by switching the pin at the gate between LOW and HIGH.  The load, for instance
  a motor, can usually be controlled betwen full 'on' and full 'off' by using pulse width modulation (PWM).  In the Arduino
  code, this is done with the function analogWrite().  See the Arduino reference for details.

  - The current can be provided by:
    - The 5V power pin on the Microcontroller board - not good for more than a few 100 mA.
    - An external power supply, accessed through the "vin" pin on some boards - still only good for ~ 1 Ampere.
    - An external power supply, with positive lead going directly to the motor, and returning from
    the motor to the FET drain.  Now you are limited only by the capabilities of the FET!



- The FET that we have in stock, IRLD024, can conduct up to 2.5 Amps.  This is enough for most things that you will need to drive.
If yuu need more, we have bigger FETS in stock as well.  Check the [datasheet](http://www.vishay.com/docs/91308/sihld24.pdf) for details.
the first part of the datasheet for this part is shown below.  Use the labels on the picture of the device to help you orient and
connect the FET on your breadboard.

- A bigger FET, that conducts up to 55 amperes, is available as well.  Its designation is P55NF06.
 Its datasheet is
 [here.](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/49/c5/a8/71/93/60/4f/86/CD00002690.pdf/files/CD00002690.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00002690.pdf)  

- The FETs we have shown here are all n-type MOSFETs (Metal oxide - silicon Field Effect Transistor).  They also come in p-type,  which turn on when the gate is at a lower
voltage than the source.

- When driving a motor or solenoid, or other inductive load (load that creates a magnetic field) it is necessary
to add a diode across the motor leads, as pictured above, in order to protect the FET from high transient voltages that
occur as the current is being switched off.  Notice that the diode is placed so that it does not conduct when the load
is energized.
