/*
 * Simple code for controlling a common-cathode RGB LED.
 * Anodes are connected through resistors to digital ouput pins.
 * Common cathode is connected to ground.  Individual LEDs are on when 
 * the corresponding pin is HIGH.
 * 
 * The other type, common-anode RGB LED, is controlled by connecting
 * each cathode to an I/O pin, in which case the LED is on when the
 * corresponding piun is LOW.
