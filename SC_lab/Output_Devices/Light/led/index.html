##Light Emitting Diode (LED)

An LED is a semiconductor device that emits light when a current passes through it.  Most LEDs emit light in a small range of wavelenghts,
so that they have a characteristic color.  We have LEDs from infrared (~890 nm) through ultraviolet (~400 nm wavelength).  A specially deisgned "white" LED
emits light over the whole visible spectrum, and appears colorless to our vision.

Most of our LEDS dissipate little power - a few tens of millwatts.  More powerful (and cheap) LEDs are available now, in commercial lighting, and also
in individual devices.

An LED is shown above.  The long leg must be at a more positive voltage than the shorter lead in order for the
device to emit light.  The electronic symbol is shown on the right.  The positive terminal is called the anode, and the
negative (lower in this picture) terminal the cathode.
In the symbol, the arrow points in the direction that current flows during
usual operation of the diode.

is a code for writing to LED with digitalWrite - full on or full off.

<a href="./LED_driver02.ino">Here</a> is code for controlling intensity of LED with analogWrite.



###RGB (red, green, blue) LEDs

Above is the four-legged RGB LED that we have.  Diagrams from the [datasheet](http://www.kingbrightusa.com/images/catalog/SPEC/WP154A4SUREQBFZGC.pdf)
show details of the configuration.  The three LEDs within this package have a common cathode (negative terminal).  The longest lead is
the cathode.  Not all RGB LEDs have this arrangement - for each type of RGB that you encounter, you will have to ascertain the arrangement of the
leads by testing or referring to the datasheet.

###LED arrays.  [Charlieplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing)
is a way that you can control N*(N-1) LEDs with
only N microcontroller ouputs.  [Here's an example](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/output_devices/array/hello.array.44.mp4) from "How to Make (Almost) Anything"
