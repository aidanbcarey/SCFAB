###stepper motor board with ATSAMD11.

This is a circuitboard designed by Ben Brown here at Harvard, with:

 1. An SAMD11 microcontroller with USB connection for programming and providing logic power.  Details for programming this micro are [here.](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Electronics/Microcontrollers/ATSAMD11/Advanced_circuits_board/index.html)
 2. Two [h-bridges](https://www.allegromicro.com/~/media/Files/Datasheets/A4950-Datasheet.ashx).  These are the chips just above the middle in this picture.
 3. Two LEDs  for code diagnostics.
 4. A 2x2 header that brings out pins 31 and 30 appearing in this picture on the bottom of the board, to the left of the micro-USB connector.  These two pins can be used for general purpose digital input/output, and can serve as serial communication pins when you want to communicate between microcontroller boards.  More on that on another page!

 You can program the SAMD11 to drive the stepper, or other motors.  The 2x2 header gives you a convenient way to network this board with other boards, to make a multi-axis machine, for example.
