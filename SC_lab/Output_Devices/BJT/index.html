####A transistor is useful when you need to control a current larger than ~40 mA (0.040 Amperes) with a microcontroller.

The NPN transistors that we have can conduct up to 1 Ampere.  Larger capacities are available.
For larger currents, we often use [FETs](../FET/index.html) instead.

- The signal voltage is attached through a resistor to the base of the transistor.  When the gate voltage is zero, the transistor blocks the flow of current.
When the gate voltage rises above zero (ground), the transistor conducts current.
It requires a very small current (few mA) into the base to control a larger current (~ 1A in this example) flowing from
collector to emitter of the transistor.

- When driving a motor or solenoid, or other inductive load (load that creates a magnetic field) it is necessary
to add a diode across the motor leads, as pictured above, in order to protect the FET from high transient voltages that
occur as the current is being switched off.  Notice that the diode is placed so that it does not conduct when the load
is energized.

- The load can be turned off and on just by switching the pin at the gate between LOW and HIGH.  The load, for instance
a motor, can usually be controlled betwen full 'on' and full 'off' by using pulse width modulation (PWM).  In the Arduino
code, this is done with the function analogWrite().  See the Arduino reference for details.

####Here is one way to make a more permanent circuit to drive a motor.

Sketch on the left, and soldered-up protoboard on the right.  As in the breadboards, the columns of holes are connected
electrically on the underneath side of the board.
