###Solenoids (electromagnets)

Here is one of many types of electromagnetic solenoid actuators.  They usually need more
 current than the microcontroller pins can supply,
so we use an [FET](./../FET/index.html) driver. The current can be provided by:
  - The 5V power pin on the Arduino board - not good for more than 100 to a few 100 mA.
  - An external power supply, accessed through the "vin" pin of the Arduino - still only good for ~ 1 Ampere.
  - An external power supply, with positive lead going directly to the FET drain.  Now you are limited only by the
    capabilities of the FET!

###Linear actuators

####Lead screws.

Leadscrews convert rotary to linear motion.  The screw threads engage with a nut,
which travels a fixed linear distance for each rotation of the motor.  Here are two stepper motors
with lead screws. This is the typical way that 3D printers and computer controlled cutting machines work.
