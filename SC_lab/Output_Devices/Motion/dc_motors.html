###DC motors

DC motors are driven by supplying a voltage to the leads, and will reverse if the voltage is reversed.

  - Brushed DC motors.   Drive with [FET](./../FET/index.html) (single direction) or
    [h-bridge](./../h_bridge/index.html) (bidirectional)

  - Geared Brushed DC motors.  Slower and more powerful than direct-drive.
   Drive with [FET](./../FET/index.html) (single direction) or
    [h-bridge](./../h_bridge/index.html) (bidirectional)

  - Brushless DC motors.  High performance, high speed, efficient.  Require electronic speed
  control (ESC) modules which receive pulses from a microcontroller (e.g. Arduino) to set the speed.
