/*
 Bidirectional motor driver uses the dual H-bridge driver module.
 Inputs to the module on pins 9 and 10.
 VCC on the driver module connected to Vin on the Arduino board.
 GND on the module to GND on the Arduino.

 Driver channels are fully on when inputs are LOW.
 If you need variable speed, use analogWrite.
 
 
  This example code is in the public domain.
