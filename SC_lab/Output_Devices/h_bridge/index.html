###H-Bridge

<b>Controlling positive and negative current.</b>

  - DC motors are driven by supplying a voltage to the leads, and will reverse if the voltage is reversed.  The pins
of the Arduino can only supply 40 mA of current, not enough to power most motors.
A motor driver is used when you want to run a motor with more current, for example the current
that might be supplied from an external power supply through the "vin" pin, but still control the motor
with a digital output pin.  If you only need to run a motor in one direction, a single [FET](../FET/index.html) will
suffice.  However, if you need to be able to run the current (and the mnotor) in both directions, you'll need something like an
[h-bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_bridge).  An h-bridge can be built from components, purchased as a chip, or as a module.

  - The h-bridge [module](http://www.mpja.com/H-Bridge-Power-Driver-Dual-Channel-L9110/productinfo/31596+MP) that we have
currently in the bins is pictured below. It can provide 800 mA to each of two motors, and can run them in either direction.


- The input wires are connected on the lower edge of the board:  in this picture red to "vin", black to ground,
and gray and white digital pins to control clockwise and counterclocwise respectively.  The motor runs when the input
pin is at a low voltage and stops when the pin is brought high or disconnected.

- The analogWrite function can be used to control the motor between 0 (fully on) and 255 (fully off).
- This board can be used to provide
 current to other output devices - for example to speakers.  One of these boards can be used to
 run a bipolar stepper motor.
