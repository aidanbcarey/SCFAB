###H-Bridge Module.  

<b>Controlling positive and negative current.</b>

  - DC motors are driven by supplying a voltage to the leads, and will reverse if the voltage is reversed.  The pins
of the Arduino can only supply 40 mA of current, not enough to power most motors.
A motor driver is used when you want to run a motor with more current, for example the current
that might be supplied from an external power supply through the "vin" pin, but still control the motor
with a digital output pin.  If you only need to run a motor in one direction, a single [FET](../FET/index.html) will
suffice.  However, if you need to be able to run the current (and the mnotor) in both directions, you'll need something like an
[h-bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_bridge).  An h-bridge can be built from components, purchased as a chip, or as a module.

  - The h-bridge [module](http://www.mpja.com/H-Bridge-Power-Driver-Dual-Channel-L9110/productinfo/31596+MP) that we have
currently in the bins is pictured below. It can provide 800 mA to each of two motors, and can run them in either direction.

- This board can be used to provide
 current to other output devices - for example to speakers.  One of these boards can be used to
 run a bipolar stepper motor.

###Tutorial - steps in connecting a motor to the h-bridge module.

 1. Attach a power supply to the GND and VCC pins of the module.  You may want to use female-female socket wires.
 2. Attach motor leads to the output connectors, using a small screwdriver to clamp leads into connectors.
 3. Attach two leads to the appropriate signal pins on left or right (eg, B-1A and B-1B).  White and gray in the image below.
 4. Verify the motor turns clockwise or counterclockwise respectively, when you ground the signal leads.  When the voltage on the signal pins is high (3.3V) the motor is off in that direction.
 5. Attach the signal leads to microcontroller pins and control direction and speed.  When you use analogWrite, remeber that OFF=255 and ON=0.  See the code examples.

###Running a stepper motor with the h-bridge module.

![pic](./bipolar_stepper_driver.jpg)

[here](./stepper_oneStepAtATime.txt) is the example program downloaded from the Arduino IDE examples, for driving a stepper motor.  To use this program with the h-bridge module:

 1. Connect the four pins of your mcrocontroller board to B-1A, B-1B, A-1A, and A-1B pins of the h-bridge module.
 2. Connect your motor leads to the ouput terminals.  You need to identify pairs of leads that are connected to the same coil.  Use your multimeter to find pairs of wires that have a resistance of a few ohms between them.  Connect each pair to one of the output connectors.  The order of the two wires does not matter - reversing the wires just changes the direction of rotation.
 3. Connect power and ground to the h-bridge module.  Use the 9V power supply.                                                              
 4. Run the program.  The stepper library should be a part of the Arduino IDE already.
