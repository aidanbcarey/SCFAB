##Light actuated drawing machine.
###First steps.
![pic](sketch.jpg)

I would like to build a roving machine that draws in response to light level.  This could be used to map out and display
light levels in a plane.  With added lenses and mirrors, the device could reproduce an image.  The sketch above gives a rough idea.
The chopper modulates the light coming from the image, and the detector is synchronized to the frequency of the chopper so that it is selectively
sensitive to the light coming from the external object, rejecting the background signal.

Above is a first quick protype, using an organ pipe solenoid mounted to a dowel.  The dowel is glued to a wood base, and a wood
screw used to attach the solenoid.  The pen is attached with gaffer's tape.  I will use this to learn how much current/voltage is
needed to actuate the pen.

###Arduino prototype.

Built an Arduino prototype that responds to light using a phtotransistor.
The phototransistor signal increases with increasing light level.
A solenoid is attached, and powered through a MOS FET (add link to MOSFET PAGE).
A potentiometer is added, and the code activates the solenoid whenever the light signal is greater than
the potentiometer signal.  This allows adjustment of threshold without reprogramming.

A schematic of the setup for the light-activated electromagnet.  The microcontroller program compares the two analog
input voltages.  When the light sensor signal is greater than the potentiometer signal, the output voltage is made
high, and the magnet is activated.

Closeups of [phototransistor](../../Sensors/Light/Photodetectors/index.html) and potentiometer.  (link to phototransistor page.)
Long leg of phototransistor goes
to lower voltage side.  Resistor is 10kOhms.  Sensitivity increases for larger
resistor value.  Signal is connected to A0 of the Arduino with the yellow wire.
For the potentiometer (need link here), the ground ad 5V lines are black and red, respectively, and
the signal is connected to the Arduino A1 pin with the green wire (the wiper).

Here is a more compact iteration of the device.  This board was made in the lab, but the small Arduino boards (micro and nano)
can also be used to make more compact and durable projects.

Here the device is mapping out the light level in the shadow of a wood piece.
