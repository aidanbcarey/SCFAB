###Actuator

In January 2019, Victoria Shen and Rob Hart worked with Axel Kilian at MIT, who has developed a practical method for
making McKibben actuators from bicycle innertubes and plastic cable jacket webbing.  Below are photographs from the construction of three
actuators in the MIT architecture shop.

###Demonstration of actuator.

[program for attiny45 microcontroller](valve.c) and [makefile](hello.45.make)

[Eagle files](./Valve_driver.zip)
Note that these files need rework: 1. Footprint for power socket not correct. 2.  Cround trace needs to extend to regulator.

Circuitboard for controlling solenoid valves.  Runs on 8.4V with 5V regulator for microcontroller
(attiny 45).  Two solenoids (MOSFET switched).  One button for fill, one for vent.  Uses a small
tank with regulator.

Pneumatics:  lower left, out.  Upper left, in.  Right, vent.  Middle, to be used for pressure sensor.
