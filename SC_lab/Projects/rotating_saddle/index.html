###Making a rotating potential surface.

A rotating saddle-shaped surface is a physical model for a dynamic electrostatic trapping method for charged particles - a Paul (or Penning?) Trap.  I'm working with colleagues in Srping 2020 to extend this method as a demonstration of newer aspects of trapping, including asymmetric potentials.

First, I needed to find a way to turn a function into sn stl for printing or machining.  I used Python, with a module that creates stl meshes from surfaces.  I wrote a program to define vetrices and triangles on a surface, and used the stl module to create the binary stl file.  Documented in the following link.

[calculating an stl](../../Tools/3D_design/Calculating_stl/index.html)

I printed out this stl using PET-G.  Sanded to remove most rough places.  Coated with xTC360 from Reynolds - epoxy conformal coat.

Below is the driving setup.  Potentiometer controls speed up to about 300 RPM (5 RPS) at 9V. Tried with V up to 12V to get a bit faster.

![saddle](Stepper_setup.jpg)

Played a bit with styrofoam ball 100mm diam and pingping ball 40mm diam.  There is a range of speed (~120 RPM) in which either ball remains within the boundaries for several seconds, executing small orbits, and rotating around its axis.  Lower speeds are unstable, and higher less stable as well.  Reminds me of the problem of the ball on a flat rotating table, for which there are stable orbits.  It would be good to trapping of a non-rotating mass - hoping that a levitating chip of solid CO2 might work.  Ice cube has too much friction.

See movie for an example:   [Link to movie](./saddle2.mp4)

###June 18

Tried Solid CO2 - chips move around with a layer of gas underneath when placed on room T metal (eg copper sheet).  this is nice, and stable for a while.

On the PTEG, the chips make a cold spot and stick.  They are more mobile if I warm up the material with a heat gun.  No chance to trap particles this way.  Might work to put it all in a heated box.

Tried liquid Nitrogen.  Some droplets are long-lived and execut stable orbits for several seconds.  Unstable at low speed, more stable intermediate, and unstable again at higher speed.  Stablility at roughly 120 RPM.  See movie:

[Link to movie](https://youtu.be/t8uqzygXVX8)  In this movie, speeds are low, med, high, med, low.  Set quality to highest in viewer, view in full screen, slow it down to 0.25 speed for best drop viewing!

###June 20

Talked with Louis and Aidan  on 6/18/20.  We will try a model with h0 (where y=(x0/ho**2)*x**2) a factor of 2-3 smaller.  Then transfer technology to Aidan for making and measuring.  Also try to reproduce results of the [2002 paper](./Canadian_2002.pdf), using bearings and low friction Teflon lubricant.

Replace stepper with gearmotor.  I have one that can spin at a few rps.  This will make control easier.  Use 19V supply, breadboarded Arduino with MOSFET, sensor for rotation speed.

###Sept 18

Talked with Louis a couple days ago.   We want to make an assymetric model to do a comparison with the earlier symmetric one.  Then transfer printing and experimenting to Aidan.

Dimensions of first symmetric surface:
 - width = 174mm.
 - greatest height at periphery of rectangle, h1 = 47.8 mm.
 - least height at periphery of rectangle, h2 = 4.2 mm
 - equation of parabola: y = 2.88e-3 * x^2.  Units of mm.  Drawing below to clarify this.

###Nov 2

Another round.  Made a new saddle, with a net positive bias.  Discovered that the old saddle has a small net negative bias.
The parameters are as shown in the sketch below (saddle no. 1 in parentheses):

Saddle no. 1:  positive=21.3, negative = 22.1    Slightly negative.
Saddle no. 2:  Positive = 20.2, negative = 19.4  Slightly positive.

####Stability measurements on 10/30/20.

New saddle surface, PTEG.  Print parameters [here:](rotating_saddle/Calculating_stl/saddle_Oct27_2020.3mf).
Surface is rough - no sanding yet.  Mounting is wobbly, and levelness is not
yet well controlled.

Use styrofoam ball:  r = 30mm ; m = 2.1g; Kinda lumpy.

[Python notebook for measurements of stability](./Measurements/Saddle_data_10.30.20.ipynb)  This notebook creates <thead>
  figure below, where blue circles represent trapping times for the first saddle, and red circles for the second, slightly positively
  biased saddle.

 - Points in the graph at trapping time of 30 seconds are all actually >30 seconds.

Next:

 - Make mounting system so that levelness is controlled. Check stability,
 - Sand surface and compare stability.
 - Find better ball?
 - Make more permanent speed sensor setup.
 - Make more careful measurements of surface.
 - Consider machining surfaces in wood.


 ####Continue, Nov 15-16.

Made a three bearing system for levelling.  Since 3D printed saddle is warped, by ~1-2 mm at base, this did not give a
level saddle.  Abandoned this approach,but took a data run with the r=30mm ball.

Below is stability data:

 - Red:  Saddle riding on three bearings.  About a 1-2mm vertical discrepancy due to warpage.
 - Blue:  Return to direct mounting on motor.  By adjusting support, I get approx. level, but this motor coupling is
 even more floppy than that in the previous figure.
 - Yellow:  Same as blue, after sanding.


![pic](./Measurements/three_sets.png)  Figure generated [by Jupyter Notebook Python](./Measurements/Saddle_data_NOV15.ipynb)

I don't see any significant difference among these sets.  Yellow may be a bit more stable overall,due to smoother surface.  So far,
the clearest difference is between old and new saddle.

It seems like small wobbles and departures from level are important, and that the 3D printed saddles are distorted enough
that it makes a difference.

Time to make a machined saddle??

The sanded surface is better now for the pingpong ball and the 110mm diameter foam ball.

#### Nov. 23

Notes on saddle.

Sandwich of 3X3/4" hardwood plywood, glued with wood glue, and 0.25" Garolite glued with high peel strength epoxy.

Notes on machining saddle.

 - Face off bottom with 1/2" mill.
 - Export STL from Prusa software, to make replica of latest surface.
 - Roughing.  Use model, boundary offset 0.51 inches, to cut down to bottom.   Use 0.5" end mill with ~2.5" depth of flute.
 - Finishing cuts, two at 45 and -45 degrees.  Use model, offset 0.45 inches, to cut to edge without cutting sides.
 - Profile cut, based on a vector drawn around model.  Cuts all the way through block, leaving some tabs.
 - Drill cut, 1/8" mill, hole in center.
 - Holddown screws too close to model.  Better would be 10x10 bottom piece with screws at 9.5" separation. (4.75 from center.)

### Dec 1

Use sanded wooden saddle on three bearings. Level to < 1mm. same r=30mm ball
Ball seems to stay in nearly stable orbits, slowly moving to greater r.

![data](./Measurements/Python_fig_Dec_1.png)

finding stable orbit depends on initial conditions and irregularities of ball?

See movie of 1.50 rps in which ball ends up rotating with saddle, sitting stably in one position.
See movie of large ball at 3RPS and smallball at 5RPS.  Ball ends up in stable orbit in which its rotation axis
points in constant direction as the ball rotates just off center.
