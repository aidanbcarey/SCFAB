###Project(s) involving temperature control.

See [Thermistor page](./../../Sensors/Thermistor/index.html)

For summer 2020, we are working with student kits that contain 100 Ohm 3 Watt resistors, and a 9V power supply.

This is a recipe for heat!   9V  across 100 Ohms gives 0.8W.

I'd like to make a garlic-curing chamber, which needs ~85 Celcius for ~ two months in order to make [black garlic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_garlic#:~:text=Black%20garlic%20is%20a%20type,that%20results%20in%20black%20cloves.)

I have a vacuum thermos-type bottle.  Can I use it, or something like it to control temperature at this level?

####I attached a resistor to a metal bracket using 5 mninute epoxy.

Soldered.

Heat-shrink applied.

Glued with thermocouple to bracket.

And here's the whole setup.

After heating up several hours, reaches 62 Celcius:

Turn off heat and remove the cork.

I need more heat or better insulation to get up to 85C.  Might just use 2-3 100 Ohm resistors in parallel.   When I  get there:

 - Write code for temperature control.
 - Write code to save data and send it out to computer.
 - Make sure temperature is uniform.  Use oil?  
 - Figure out how to make a garlic container.  Plastic vacuum bag?
 - I really don't want to commit an expensive board to this purpose for two months - needs either
 	- A home-made board.
 	- A cheap Arduino clone.
