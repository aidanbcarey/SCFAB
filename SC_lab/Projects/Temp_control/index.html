###Project(s) involving temperature control.

See [Thermistor page](./../../Sensors/Thermistor/index.html)

For summer 2020, we are working with student kits that contain 100 Ohm 3 Watt resistors, and a 9V power supply.

This is a recipe for heat!   9V  across 100 Ohms gives 0.8W.

I'd like to make a garlic-curing chamber, which needs ~85 Celcius for ~ two months in order to make [black garlic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_garlic#:~:text=Black%20garlic%20is%20a%20type,that%20results%20in%20black%20cloves.)

I have a vacuum thermos-type bottle.  Can I use it, or something like it to control temperature at this level?

####I attached a resistor to a metal bracket using 5 mninute epoxy.

Soldered.

Heat-shrink applied.

Glued with thermocouple to bracket.

And here's the whole setup.

After heating up several hours, reaches 62 Celcius:

Turn off heat and remove the cork.

I need more heat or better insulation to get up to 85C.  Might just use 2-3 100 Ohm resistors in parallel.   When I  get there:

 - Write code for temperature control.
 - Write code to save data and send it out to computer.
 - Make sure temperature is uniform.  Use oil?  
 - Figure out how to make a garlic container.  Plastic vacuum bag?
 - I really don't want to commit an expensive board to this purpose for two months - needs either
 	- A home-made board.
 	- A cheap Arduino clone.

###Now, about using thermistor as a flow sensor....

[Earlier thoughts](https://roberthart56.github.io//projects/Thermistor_anemometry/index.html), on using a tiny thermistor, are linked.  With a small 100 Ohm thermistor, it was easy to heat up the thermistor enough so that the change in its heat dissipation with airflow can be detected.

How about for this thermistor with 9V?  ~1/100 W.  How much does this thermistor heat up in air when 9V is applied.  Here are some notes:

![pic](./notes_power.jpg)

Slope of the temp curve at 25C is 500 Ohm per degree.  Heats up about a degree.  Could see this more easily with a bridge circuit.  Then measure differential voltage.  Can do this with SAMD21 - one way is to use the library that I found on github as an example for accessing the advanced ADC functions via registers.  This micro has capabilities of amplification, and differential inputs.
