Using mostly summer 2020 kit materials, I want to make a moveable stage for sewing that can develop into an embroidery attachment for any machine.  

For this I need to sense when the needle is up, and move the stage before the needle returns.  If stitching at ten stiches per second, this gives about 50 ms to move a few mm.  Sounds pretty easy with stepper motor and belt drive - or maybe just a string - capstan drive.

First, place magnet on steel wheel of machine and bring [magnetic sensor](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/magnetic/index.html) close.  Below is the setup.  I used a couple pieces of wood, but could have used cardboard (lasercut or knife-cut).
