###Solderable protoboard with Arduino Mini:  making a compact and robust prototype.

In order to make a viable project prototype, you need to move beyond the floppy-wire protoboard stage, and solder wires and components
so that you have a robust and compact version of your project.  One way to do this is to use a compact version of the Arduino, attached
to a small solderable protype board, like [this one](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12702) from Sparkfun.

Above left is the circuit that I need.  Two FET's to switch on two motors in one direction.  The sketch to the right
shows how I plan to make the connections on the protboard.

Here is the board, front and back.  Components are on one side.  The Arduino Mini will attach to the other.  Connections are
made with solid core wire.

The finished project.  It works.  Cheaper and easier is to design and make your own board with surface-mount
components, including the microprocessor.  This involves several skills that you can learn:  designing circuits and
boards in a circuit design program like Kicad, Eagle, or Altium, machining (or etching) you boards, soldering on components,
and programming.
