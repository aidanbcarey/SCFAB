1. Acrylic disc, cut on scroll saw, drilled, pressed onto motor shaft.  Two copper foil sheets to form capacitive rotation sensor.
2. Doll arm, drilled, pressed on to motor gearhead.  Servomotor hot glued to box lid.
3. Cable tie attached to motor shaft.  Spin at variable speed to control pitch as cable tie hits material.
4. Daniel Rosenberg's LED lamp.  Copper foil, wires, LEDs inserted into laser cut cardboard.  Aduino Nano controls lights.
5. Pipe organ solenoid attached to wood parts (cut and glued).  Actuates pen to make a drawing machine.
6.  Doll head hot glued to vibration (eccentric rotor) motor.  Attached by spring and magnet to metal lid to make a loud noise.
7.  Doll foot drilled and attached to motor shaft, spring and wood ball attached by friction.
8.  Doll foot hot-glued to Organ solenoid to make chime ringer.
9.  Cowbell ringer.  Polyethylene tubing pressed over motor shaft, pressed into drilled hole in wood toy part.  When the motor turns, the wood piece rings the bell.
10. Doll arm, drilled.  Hits steel sheet to make sound.
11. Wire current loop interacts with magnet hanging on thin plastic cord to make a pendulum driver.
