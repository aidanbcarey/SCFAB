###Developing a soldered protoboard for an Arduino projecgt.

Arduino Uno and breadboard.  Fritzing Schematic.

 Sketched schematic.  Use large n-type Feild Effect Transistor (FET).  This large transistor
was chosen bercause it is easier to see how it fits.  The smaller FET in the inventory would work as well, but its legs need
to be bent to fit in the protoboard, and the order of its pins is different.  See details on the [FET page](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Output_Devices/FET/index.html)

Next, show photo of board with components soldered.

Next, add the Arduino.

Next show use of only half board.

Now show how to use IRLD024 n-mosfet on protoboard.
