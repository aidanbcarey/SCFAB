##Nine FETs, surface mount, ribbon cable connector.
###Eagle files and traces.

####Original board, in which wire needs to be added to connect grounds.

These files are at 1000 dpi resolution.  When imported into mods, these files give a result that is two times too large.
The dpi in the mods window needs to be set to 2000 dpi to make the board come out at the right scale.

####Two-layer board, in which ground connection is made using holes, rivets and soldering to a bottom ground plane.

Note that all the two-layer files are 2000 dpi resolution.  When imported into mods, these files give a result that is two times too large.
The dpi in the mods window needs to be set to 4000 dpi to make the board come out at the right scale.
