<title>Gothic Storm window.  Exporting DXF files in Fusion 360</title>

<xmp theme="bootstrap" style="display:none;">
<br>



##Fusion file.

[Fusion 360 file](./window_arch_v1.f3d) that has in sketch 1 the full construction and in
a second sketch the trimmed version for output to laser cutter or mill.

![pic](full_sketch.png)
![pic](trimmed_sketch.png)

The full (left) and trimmed (right) sketches.  The sketch on the right has beebn trimmed and the
curve offset to create the acrylic shapes that i need for windows.

I need to cut the inner and outer lines separately, to get two panes of acrylic for a storm window.
I will change line widths within the laser cutter software to cut the ones that I want.
