  Button

 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to pin A0 (used as a digital output),
 when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 12.


 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground
 * pushbutton attached to pin 12 and ground.

// constants won't change. They're used here to
// set pin numbers:
const int buttonPin = 12;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin = 13;      // the number of the LED pin


void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input, using input pullup:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop() {

  if (digitalRead(buttonPin)== LOW) {      //read the button pin and turn LED on if pushed.
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  }

  else{                        //else, leave LED off if not pushed.
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
