        <li>Analog reads ten data points, stores the values in an array.
          When button is pressed Ardutxt sends the values through
          serial. Values can be received by computer software. One way
          is to use the Ardutxt serial monitor to receive data and cut
          and paste into a spreadsheet. Button is simply connected to
          digital pin 7 and to ground. The input pullup resistor is
          internal to the microprocessor, and keeps the level HIGH until
          the button is pressed.</li>
        <li>This program stores data in RAM (data memory), of which
          there is 2kBytes in the Ardutxt. This means that up to 1000
          two-byte integers could be stored. Actually, since RAM is used
          for storage of other variables in your program, the space is
          more limited. Also, RAM data disappears when the device is
          reset or turned off. For more permanent storage, use program
          memory or EEPROM memory. Check the Ardutxt Reference for
          details. See also this <a
