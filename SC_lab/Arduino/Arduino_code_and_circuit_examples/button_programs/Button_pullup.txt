  Button

 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to pin A0 (used as a digital output),
 when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 12.  Requires setting digital input as having internal hardware pullup.


 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin A0 to ground
 * pushbutton attached to pin 12 and ground.

// constants won't change. They're used here to
// set pin numbers:
const int buttonPin = 12;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin = A0;      // the number of the LED pin

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input, using input pullup:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed.
  // if it is, the buttonState is LOW:
  if (buttonState == LOW) {
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
}
