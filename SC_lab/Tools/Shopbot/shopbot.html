##Shopbot Procedures

###Safety Guidelines


  - Wear eye and ear protection.
  - Closed-toe shoes.
  - No loose hair or clothing.
  - Never reach into area with moving tools.
  - Know how to stop machine before you start it.
  - Never work alone or when tired.

###Design rules

These are rules that apply no matter what your workflow.

  - Add holes in your design, or during your use of the Aspire (Shopbot) software, for material hold-down screws.
  Screwheads are ~9mm.  Holes can be drilled with 0.125" end mill.  This should be a separate toolpath, to
  be executed at the start of the cutting job.
  - Clearances (assuming a 0.125" endmill ~3.2mm diameter)
    - Between parts and the material boundary at least 12 mm.
    - Between parts and centers of screw-holes ~12mm.
    - Between parts ~12mm, but can be ~6mm where there are no tabs placed.
  - For parts that slot together, modify inside corners where needed, using for example, tbones, dogbones, or extra holes.
  This cabn be done in your design software, or in the Aspire software that generates toolpaths for shopbot.





###Creating a Toolpath in Aspire. (Shopbot-provided software)

This software is available on three Windows computers in the lab:  The computer connected to the laser cutter, the vinyl cutter computer, and the windows machine in the circuitboard milling room.
 You may also arrange to install it on your own (Windows) machine - contact Rob.


  <ol>
    <li>Design in 2D cad software of your choice.  Optionally add holes for material hold-down and "dogbone" relief features.
      Export as DXF.
    <li>Measure material</li>
    <li>Open Aspire software, choose “new file”.</li>
    <li>Material setup</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter material x and y size.</li>
        <li>Enter material thickness.</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Import vector or draw vector.</li>
    <li>Add holes for material hold-down.</li>
    <li>Add slot relief where needed (e.g. "dogbone fillet")</li>
    <li>Where needed, remove extra vectors, close vectors, clean up.</li>
    <li>Create toolpath </li>

      <ul>

        <li>Hole toolpath for material hold-down</li>
        <li>Select vectors and create profile toolpath for cutout.</li>
        <li>Choose tool, cut depth, and other parameters (following are suggestions for OSB).</li>
          <ul>
            <li>tool - 1/8”</li>
            <li>spindle speed 18000 rpm</li>
            <li>3 in/sec</li>
            <li>cut depth per pass 0.2”</li>
          </ul>
      	<li>Create tabs.  Reasonable size is 0.4” wide by 0.1” thick.</li>
        <li>Preview  all toolpaths to make sure tool will not encounter screws.</li>
      </ul>
<li>Save toolpath(s) as Shopbot (inch) format with "sbp" extension.</li>
  </ol>



###Running a shopbot toolpath file.
<ol>
      <li>Place material on the bed.</li>
      <li>Insert the appropriate bit.</li>
      <li>Zero the bit in x, y, and z.</li>
      <li>Make sure spindle control window is open (Tools menu) or, on Shopbot Desktop machine, that spindle is on.</li>
      <li>Do an air cut.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>move z-zero up.</li>
          <li>run files</li>
        </ul>
<li>Cut part</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Spindle on.</li>
    <li>Return z-zero to real zero.  Check.</li>
    <li>run hole file</li>
    <li>Screw down material.</li>
    <li>Adjust z-zero.</li>
    <li>Run cut files.</li>
  </ul>
