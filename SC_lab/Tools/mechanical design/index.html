#From HTMAA machine week.

[Jake's 2019 website:](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/jakeread/machineweek-2019)

Look at design of axes:
  - 3D printed parts with inserts.
  - 5mm bearings with shoulder bolts and washers as shims.
  - Belts and pulleys.

This can solve most simple problems.  Can replace PLA with wood, bearings with dowels and wooden spools, and so on.....
