### April 13, 2020

Sort out what to do for machine week.  Maybe: Keyboard entry, or text file with list of address + number.  Write program for board(s) to respond to address and numbers by doing something.  e.g. stepper on address 255 rotates, servo on address 254 moves radially, to make drawing machine.  This could all be on same board, or two boards. 

The following codes:

[simple serial bridge for SAMd11](./d11_serial_bridge.txt).  simple bridge between usb and uart.  Copied from HTMAA

[program to detect address and step](./samd11_stepper_4.txt)  .  This is the code used to parse address and number of steps.  When it receives address, 255, it takes the next byte and uses it to determine steps between -120 and 120.  It needs a UART byte. 

[serial string to integer 02](./serial_string_to_int_02.txt)  Converts ASCII to integer and prints it on Serial.  With this, I can send a hex value to USB on SAMD11, and the board will send the value on via usart to the attached board(s).

Now modify the string-to-integers code:

[serial string to integer 03](./serial_string_to_int_03.txt)  Converts ASCII to integer byte and sends it to Serial1.  accepts address, then 0-240 which maps onto -120 to 120.

[serial string to integer 04](./serial_string_to_int_04.txt)  Converts ASCII to integer byte.  If it is in the range -120 to 120, converts to unsigned integer and sends as a byte.  Now the sequence is:  1.  send and address.  2. send a character string between -120 and 120.  

[program to detect address and move servo](./servo_addr_254.txt)  .  This is the code used to parse address and angle.  When it receives address, 254, it takes the next byte and uses it to determine angle.  Maps to byte using the same function as the stepper.  It needs a UART byte.

1.  See about converting text files.
2.  Make example of stepper driver with two digital inputs.
3.  Document example of single-byte stepper.
