### Networked mnachine demo.

![sketch](./machine_sketch.jpg)

This page describes a drawing machine with two degress of freedom, made from the Spring 2020 kit for PS70.  It illustrates some aspects common to most networked machines.

[serial string to integer 07](./serial_string_to_int_07.txt) This is the code that resides in the bridge, <b>B</b>.  Reads and sends an arbitrary number of bytes in groups of four.  Can be used to send a text or csv file from coolterm.  Can also cut and paste into Arduino serial monitor send from text or spreadsheet.   

[program to detect address and step](./samd11_stepper_4.txt)  .  This is the code used to parse address and number of steps, in <b>C1</b> above.  When it receives address, 255, it takes the next byte and uses it to determine steps between -120 and 120.  

[program to detect address and move servo](./servo_addr_254.txt)  .  This is the code used to parse address and angle, in <b>C2</b>.  When it receives address, 254, it takes the next byte and uses it to determine angle.  Maps to byte using the same function as the stepper.
