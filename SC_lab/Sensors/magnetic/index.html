###[Hall Sensor](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=620-1432) that we use.

Datasheet can be found on the website.  Connections and behavior as a sensor are shown below.
The sensor is only sensitive to the magnetic field component perpendicular to its face.

###Hall sensor used with a magnet as a position sensor.

The drawing below shows the magnetic field around a disc magnet, as seen from the side.  Magnetic field
as a vector quentity is shown by arrows, representing direction and intensity (arrow length).
