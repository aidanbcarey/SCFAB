###Infrared LED and photodiode.

The sketches above describe an Infrard sensor that detects reflected light from an object.

This is one way to put it together.

Here it is on a large cirsuitboard (left) and more compactly, on a small protoboard (right).

The signal from an object that passes ~two meters in front of the sensor.




### Micro

A miniaturized version of this sensor works on much smaller scales. Range is ~0 - ~10 mm with ability to see motion less than 1 mm.
This sensor also detects differences in reflectivity, so it could be used for robotic line-following and similar applications.
