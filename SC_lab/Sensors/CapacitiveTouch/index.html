###Capacitance using the Arduino Capacitive Sensing Library.

![pic](./cap01.png)

This is the configuration used for capacitance sensing with the Arduino.  The pin on the left (7 in this example)
    is used to charge the plate, through the resistor.  The pin on the right (5 in this example) senses the change in voltage as the plate charges up.
  The closer the grounded object is to the plate, the larger the capacitance, and the longer it takes to charge. The
    time for charging (in arbitrary units) is the number that is reported by the sensing function.  To use this sensor, load the Capacitive
    Sensing Library. In the Arduino IDE, use "sketch > Include Libraries > Manage Libraries".

<a href="./CapacitiveTouch.txt"> Here</a> is the sample code for Capactive Sensing that works for the configuration shown above.  The resistor R is usually 1 to 10 Mega-ohm.  The larger
resistance makes the sensor more sensitive.

As shown above, the capacitive sensor can be used to measure position, force, tilt, airspeed, and more.
