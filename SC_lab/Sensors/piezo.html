    <h2>Piezoelectric element for force, vibration, sound.</h2>
    <p>Below is shown a piezoelectric disc, and its connections to Arduino.  The schematic on the right is equivalent to the photograph on the left.</p>
      <p>The two 1MOhm resistors keep the average voltage level near 3.3V/2 = 1.65 V.  Use the voltage that is generated as the disc flexes to detect vibration, sound, force.  Notice that the voltage is transient - the level returns to 1.7 V after a fraction of a second.  For steady state measurement of force, try capacitance sensing.</p>
