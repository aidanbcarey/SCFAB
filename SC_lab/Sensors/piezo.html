    <h2>Piezoelectric element for force, vibration, sound.</h2>
    <p>Below is shown a piezoelectric disc, and its connections to Arduino.
      The 1MOhm resistor keeps the average voltage level near 3.3V.  Use the voltage that is generated as the disc flexes to detec vibration, sound, force.  Notice that <thead>
        voltage is transient - the level returns to 3.3 V after a fraction of a second.  For steady state measurement of force, try capacitance sensing.</p>
