    <h2>Light: Photoresistor.</h2>

          <p>A photoresistor changes its resistance as a function of light.  As it receives more light
            its resistance decreases, and the voltage at the point labeled A0 decreases.  Any of the analog inputs A0 - A5,
          could be used.

          <a href="./AnalogReadSerial.ino"> Here</a> is sample code using this configuration.</p>

        <p>Instead of using an external voltage divider, you can set up a "pullup" resistor internal to the microcontroller chip
          by using "pinMode(A0, INPUT_PULLUP)" in the setup function.  This makes the situation shown above, where the value at A0
          is near 5V in the dark, and approaches 0 when the photoresistor is illuminated.

    <h2>Light: Phototransistor.</h2>

<p>A phototransistor functions similarly to a photoresistor.  Rather than act as a fixed resistor, the photransistor conducts
more or less current as a function of light level.  In some cases they are more sensitive than
photoresistors.  We have phototransistors that are sensitive in the visible and in the near infrared.</p>
