<p>A phototransistor conducts more or less current as a function of light level.  The signal is just the current times the resistance R.
Sensitivity can be changed by changing the value of R in the range 1kOhm - 100kOhm.  We have phototransistors that are sensitive
in the visible and others sensitive in the near infrared.   </p>

          <p>A photoresistor changes its resistance as a function of light.  As it receives more light
            its resistance decreases, and the voltage at the point labeled A0 decreases.  Any of the analog inputs A0 - A5,
          could be used.

          <a href="./AnalogReadSerial.ino"> Here</a> is sample code using this configuration.</p>
