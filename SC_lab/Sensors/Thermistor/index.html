###Thermistor.

[Thermistor datasheet](https://www.vishay.com/docs/29049/ntcle100.pdf)

A thermistor is a device whose resistance varies as a function of temperature.  It is typically used in a voltage divider circuit.

Below is the data from the datasheet.  T as a function of R between 0 and 100 C.  Make this plot, read data from [spreadsheet (csv)](./thermistor_10K_NTC.csv) using [this](./plot_csv_thermistor.py) Python code.

[Tutorial on using a thermistor](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Marcazzan_M/how-easy-is-it-to-use-a-thermistor-e39321)

Our datasheet gives the formula for converting resistance to temperature in a slightly different way than this tutorial.

Here's the data and the fit, using the datasheet formula.  To make this plot, I created a spreadsheet from the device datasheet information.  I imported this data into a Python array using the code linked below.  Then calculated and plotted the function given in the datasheet as the model for T vs R.

This plot is generated by [this](./plot_csv_thermistor_logfit.py) Python code.

Now we can confidently use this formula in the Arduino
