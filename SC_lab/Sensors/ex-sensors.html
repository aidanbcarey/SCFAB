    <h2>Voltage Divider</h2>
<p>Many sensors act as resistors that change their resistance as a function of the property measured.  </p>
<p>Remember that the voltage across a resistor
is given by Ohm's Law:  &Delta;V = (current)* resistance.  </p>
<p>When two resistors are connected in series as shown, the voltage Vout between them
is somewhere between 0V and 5V, with the exact value given by the equation below:</p>

          <a href="./AnalogReadSerial.ino"> Use analog read program</a> with Vout connected to A0 pin.</p>
            <p>A potentiometer allows a continuous variation of voltage.  It can be used as a sensor for position or rotation.</p>

    <h2>Light: Photoresistor.</h2>


        <center><img src='./photores01.jpg' width="400px" ></center>
          <p>A photoresistor changes its resistance as a function of light.  As it receives more light
            its resistance decreases, and the voltage at the point labeled A0 decreases
            In the first Arduino workshop in class, we used this configuration, called a voltage divider, measuring the voltage at A0
          while changing the amount of light received by the photoresistor.  Any of the analog inputs A0 - A5,
          could be used.  <a href="./AnalogReadSerial.ino"> Here</a> is sample code using this configuration.</p>
        <center><img src='./photores02.jpg' width="600px" ></center>
        <p>Instead of using an external voltage divider, you can set up a "pullup" resistor internal to the microcontroller chip
          by using "pinMode(A0, INPUT_PULLUP)" in the setup function.  This makes the situation shown above, where the value at A0
          is near 5V in the dark, and approaches 0 when the photoresistor is illuminated.
           <a href="./simple_light.ino"> Here</a> is sample code using this configuration.</p>



    <h2>Light: Phototransistor.</h2>
<p>A phototransistor functions similarly to a photoresistor.  Rather than act as a fixed resistor, the photransistor conducts
more or less current as a function of light level.  In some cases they are more sensitive than
photoresistors.  We have phototransistors that are sensitive in the visible and in the near infrared.</p>

    <h2>Piezoelectric element for force, vibration, sound.</h2>
    <p>Below is shown a piezoelectric disc, and its connections to Arduino.
      The 1MOhm resistor keeps the average voltage level near 3.3V.  Use the voltage that is generated as the disc flexes to detec vibration, sound, force.  Notice that <thead>
        voltage is transient - the level returns to 3.3 V after a fraction of a second.  For steady state measurement of force, try capacitance sensing.</p>

    <h2>Capacitance.(proximity, force, pressure, tilt. )</h2>
    <center><img src='./cap01.jpg' width="400px" ></center>
    <p>This is the configuration used for capacitance sensing with the Arduino.  The pin on the left (7 in this example)
      is used to charge the plate, through the resistor.  The pin on the right (5 in this example) senses the change in voltage as the plate charges up.
    The closer the grounded object is to the plate, the larger the capacitance, and the longer it takes to charge. The
      time for charging (in arbitrary units) is the number that is reported by the sensing function.  To use this sensor, load the Capacitive
      Sensing Library. In the Arduino IDE, use "sketch > Include Libraries > Manage Libraries".
      <a href='http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense'>Documentation is here. </a></p>

      <p><a href="./CapacitiveTouch"> Here</a> is the sample code for Capactive Sensing that works for the configuration shown above.  The resistor R is usually 1 to 10 Mega-ohm.  The larger
      resistance makes the sensor more sensitive.</p>
    <center><img src='./cap02.jpg' width="400px" ></center>
      <p>As shown above, the capacitive sensor can be used to measure position, force, tilt, airspeed, and more.</p>
