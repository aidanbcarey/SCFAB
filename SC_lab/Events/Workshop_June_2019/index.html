###Workshop

![pic](./Multimeter.jpg)

  - First Day
    - [Circuits](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Electronics/electronic_basics.html)
      - Make LED circuit using Arduino board as a power source.
        - Learn to strip wire.
        - Learn to use [protoboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard).
        - Use multimeter to measure voltages in the circuit.
        - Use Ohm's law to calculate current with two different resistors.
        - Make a motor turn both ways.
        - Measure current, using 100 Ohm resistor in series.
        - Run with no resistor.

    - [Programming](../../Arduino/index.html)
      - Get Arduino IDE running.
      - Open the blink program from the examples in the Arduino IDE.
      - Load it, then modify it and reload it.
      - Power your LED from the output pin used in the blink program.
      - Explore programs to control LED.
        - dimming using analogWrite
        - program to turn on by using digital input. [example program](./Arduino_examples/modified_blink/modified_blink.ino)
        - use a button to control an output. [example program](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Arduino_code_and_circuit_examples/Button_pullup.txt)
      - Learn to use phototransistor.
        - set up the circuit.
        - measure output as the light level changes, first with multimeter, then with Arduino anaolgRead.
        - use the phototransistor output, measured by the Arduino, to control an LED. (Make a night-light).
        [example program](./Arduino_examples/sensor_motor/sensor_motor.ino)
      - Try to run motor from Arduino.  Realize that programmable motor control needs another step!



  - Homework:
    - Add something to your motor to make it do something interesting.
    - Make a plan for a programmable device using buttons, phototransistors, LEDs and/or motors.
    - Think about how you will make your project compact and durable.  This might include:
      - small board, like the Arduino nano.
      - protective box.
      - soldered connections.



  - Second Day
    - Review and questions.
    - Look at homework.
    - Electronics:  [Using a transistor](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Output_Devices/BJT/index.html)
     to switch a bigger current with a smaller one.  Use a diode to protect the transistor during switching.
    - Programming:  Control your motor with the Arduino.
      - On and off.
      - Fast and slow.
    - Work on your personal project.
    - Show and tell.
    - As time allows, migrate the Arduino Uno project over to Arduino nano:
      - install [drivers](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html) and program nano with blink program.
      - Duplicate working project, using wire, solder, and little protoboards.
    - Discuss possible next steps.
