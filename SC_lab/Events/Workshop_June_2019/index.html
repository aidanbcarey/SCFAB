###Workshop

  - First Day
    - Circuits
      - Make LED circuit using Arduino board as a power source.
        - Learn to strip wire.
        - Learn to use protoboard
        - Use multimeter to measure voltages in the circuit.
        - Use Ohm's law to calculate current with two different resistors.
      - Make a motor turn both ways.  Diode protection.
        - Measure current, using 100 Ohm resistor in series.
        - Run with no resistor.

    - Programming
      - Get Arduino IDE running.
      - Open the blink program.  Modify it and load it.
      - Power your LED from a digital pin.
      - Explore programs to control LED.
        - dimming using analogWrite
        - program to turn on by using input.
        - button?
      - Learn to use phototransistor.
