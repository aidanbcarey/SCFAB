### Breakout board designed by Ben Brown.

We ordered 100 boards to breakout the pins of the ATSAMD11C14 for breadboarding.

Here is the board.

This is how you program it using the ATMEL ICE programmer and the 10-pin header.  Note the orientation of the cable.

1.  Install Open OCD.
2.  Download and unzip [this directory]().
3.  In a command window, navigate to the directory.
4.  Attach the ATMEL ICE programer as in the picture.
5.  Type "openocd".

This is an alternative way to program, not using the header.
