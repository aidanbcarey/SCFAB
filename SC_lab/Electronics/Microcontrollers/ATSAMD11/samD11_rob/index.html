#Documentation for the ATSAMD11 breakout board.

## Programming with the Arduino IDE

You have to do a little setup to get the Arduino IDE to talk to your board.

1. Go to Arduino > Preferences, and click on the button next to "Additional Boards Manager URLs"
2. Add `https://www.mattairtech.com/software/arduino/package_MattairTech_index.json`
3. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
4. Search for "Mattair", and install the "MattairTech SAM D|L|C Core for Arduino" package

That's all the installation necessary. To talk with your board, make sure you select the right board
from the boards menu (`GenericD11C14A`), and USBtinyISP for the programmer.

The original documentation is available here
[source](https://github.com/mattairtech/ArduinoCore-samd/blob/master/README.md) (scroll way down, or
seearch for "Installation").

Instructions [here](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/pub/hello-world/atsamd11/tree/master/bootloader) from Eric, posted in the 2019 HTMAA class
repository.  Hope this is public.

Shows connections to board:

  - red. 3.3V VCC  (not actually connected in this picture.  If it were, LED on header board would light)
  - black gnd
  - yellow DIO
  - orange CLK
  - green RST
