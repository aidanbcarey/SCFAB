##Adafruit ESP32 Huzzah board.



- [Adafruit page for Huzzah 32](https://www.omzlo.com/articles/programming-samd21-using-atmel-ice-with-openocd)


 We need to configure Arduino IDE to work with the Huzzah. 

 First, download and install the <a href='http://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers'> CP2104 USB Driver</a>. 

 Next, add this to Preferences &gt; Additional Boards Manager URLs: 

 <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json</code>. 

 Finally, under Tools &gt; Boards Manager, add the "esp32" boards package. Select Adafruit ESP32 Feather as your board and select the corresponding port.

<p> Note: the terms here can be confusing. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32'>ESP32</a> refers to a series of low-cost, low-power system-on-a-chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Its precursor was the ESP8266 -- many tutorials will be compatible with both. <a href='https://www.adafruit.com/feather'>Feather</a> is a line of development boards from Adafruit. The <a href='https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405'>Huzzah32</a> is the specific Feather board that is built around the ESP32. </p>
