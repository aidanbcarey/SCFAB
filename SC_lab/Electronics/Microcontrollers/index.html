###Microcontroller boards.

[D11 board](./ATSAMD11/samD11_rob/index.html) Designed by Rob, made in this lab.

[Breakout_board](./ATSAMD11/Advanced_circuits_board/index.html) designed by Ben Brown, sent out for manufacture by Advanced Circuits.  This board can be programmed using the Arduino IDE and function libraries.  They are cheap-ish.  we have a bunch. You can practice soldering surface-mount components!



[Adafruit M4, ItsyBitsy](./Adafruit/index.html) is the main board that we will use for PS70.  It speaks Arduino as well as Python.

[Adafruit M4, Express.](./Adafruit/index.html)  Like the ItsyBitsy, but has a few more pins.  It is more capable in Audio, since it does I2S.

ESP32, system on a chip, on the Adafruit Huzzah board.  We will use this in PS70 for wireless internet, bluetooth, and BLE.
