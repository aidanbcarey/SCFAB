###Microcontroller boards.

[D11 board](./ATSAMD11/samD11_rob/index.html) Designed by Rob, made in this lab.

[Breakout_board](./ATSAMD11/Advanced_circuits_board/index.html) designed by Ben Brown, sent out for manufacture by Advanced Circuits.  This board can be programmed using the Arduino IDE and function libraries.  They are cheap-ish.  we have a bunch. You can practice soldering surface-mount components!

# Programming with the Arduino IDE

You have to do a little setup to get the Arduino IDE to talk to your board.

1. Go to Arduino > Preferences, and click on the button next to "Additional Boards Manager URLs"
2. Add `https://www.mattairtech.com/software/arduino/package_MattairTech_index.json`
3. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
4. Search for "Mattair", and install the "MattairTech SAM D|L|C Core for Arduino" package

That's all the installation necessary. To talk with your board, make sure you select the right board
from the boards menu (`GenericD11C14A`), and USBtinyISP for the programmer.

The original documentation is available here
[source](https://github.com/mattairtech/ArduinoCore-samd/blob/master/README.md) (scroll way down, or
seearch for "Installation").


[Adafruit M4, ItsyBitsy](./Adafruit/index.html) is the main board that we will use for PS70.  It speaks Arduino as well as Python.

[Adafruit M4, Express.](./Adafruit/index.html)  Like the ItsyBitsy, but has a few more pins.  It is more capable in Audio, since it does I2S.

ESP32, system on a chip, on the Adafruit Huzzah board.  We will use this in PS70 for wireless internet, bluetooth, and BLE.
