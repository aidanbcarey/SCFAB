<b>Electronics basics.</b>

  - Voltage and current. [Protoboard (breadboard) circuits.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)
  Current flows through a circuit; voltage is measured across a circuit element (like a resistor), and is the energy lost per unit charge as the current flows through the circuit element.
  Metal, as that in wires, has little resistance, and voltage does not drop very much as current flows through wires.

  In the figures above, the circuit schematic on the left represents the physical situation on the right.
  Create this circuit with your Arduino and breadboard, and power the Arduino from your computer or another USB power socket.

  - Multimeter.  Now use your multimeter to measure the voltage across the resistor.

  - Ohm's law.Use Ohm's law to calculate the current flowing through
  the resistor.

  Disconnect your circuit, and use your multimeter (on the appropriate scale) to measure a resistance
  and to check a connection using the "beep" function.

  - Symbols, circuit diagrams. Above are schematic symbols for some of the circuit elements you will use.
  A diode only allows current to flow in one direction.  The arrow points in the direction of the flow.  The resistor color code is
  explained on the right-hand figure.

  - Calculating current through an LED.  An LED does not have the simple relation between voltage and current that a resistor does (Ohm's law
  does not work for diodes).  To learn what current is flowing through the LED, you need to use the fact that the current flowing through the resistor is
  the same as that flowing through the LED.  Then measure the voltage across the resistor and use Ohm's Law to find the current.
  Build the circuit shown above, and calculate the current flowing through the circuit.

  ![pic](volt_div.jpg)

  - Voltage divider.  Here is a voltage divider, which forms the basis for many sensors such as the photoresistor.  Build this circuit
  with resistors, and measure voltages.  Does it make sense to you?

    ![pic](pot.jpg)

  - Potentiometers.  A potentiometer is a voltage divider with a movable contact.  It can be used to provide a variable voltage, or act
  as a variable resistance.

  - [Arduino basics](./../Arduino/arduino_projects_book.pdf)
    - Install Arduino IDE.
    - Load and run the "blink" program
    - alter the "blink" program.
    - Measure a voltage with the Arduino.
    - Build a voltage divider circuit using the photoresistor as one of the resistors.  Use the Arduino to measure light.  See the [sensor](../Sensors.html)
    page for details and a sample program.
