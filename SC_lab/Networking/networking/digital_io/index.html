A very simple example of two boards communicating. The board on the left is programmed to write to a digital output pin in response to a button input.  The board on the right uses a digitalread() to read the voltage and responds by changing the state of an output device.  This is an example of communicating with one bit (HIGH or LOW) at a time.  The two boards just share ground.  They must both be powered, and can share a power line.

This is an example of two boards runnning this code.  A microcontroller board on left, powered through computer USB; Another microcontroller board on right, powered by rechargeable battery.  When the button is pushed, the left board sends a HIGH to the right board which moves its servo.
