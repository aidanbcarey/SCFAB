###"How to Make (Almost) Anything"

<b>First meeting: Wednesday September 4, 2019 1-4PM, MIT E14-633.</b>

This is an MIT course, MAS863, into which Harvard students can cross-register.  HTMAA is a series of weekly dives into several areas of
digital fabrication.  Students in the course learn to integrate the techniques of digital fabrication and apply them in ways important
to them, including personal fabrication, research projects, art, design, and rapid prototyping.

As a student in this course, you will learn to design, fabricate, solder, and program microcontroller circuitboards.
These boards will be used for sensing, controlling actuators, and creating machines.  You will also learn molding and casting, composite making,
 designing in 2D and 3D, using laser cutters, 3D printers, and computer controlled milling machines.

The course meets weekly on Wednesdays 1-4PM at MIT in E14-633 for lecture and presentation of weekly student work.  Harvard students
will do the hands-on part of the course in the Science Center Fabrication Shop, SC102.  You will have 24/7 access to this shop and
its tools.  You will continue to have access to this shop after the course ends.

For more information, please contact Rob Hart:  hart@g.harvard.edu.
