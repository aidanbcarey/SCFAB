###Sensors Demonstration, Sept. 23, 2020

 - Reading a photoresistor to detect light level.  Demonstrate using [Tinkercad model.](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eXd5onQdm0l-grand-turing/editel?sharecode=oTcPR817Hlrv6wQOmqi6mXQFxVYzVVlL4R0RFx7Mp7Q)

 For code, use Arduino sample code for analog Read:  "Files->examples->basics->analogRead Serial.""

 ![pic](photoresistor.png)

   - Photoresistor circuit is shown above.
   - "Analog in" on arduino gives numbers from 0 to 1023.  
   - Serial monitor is used to keep track of changing variables.

 - Temperature sensing using a  thermistor.

###Unipolar stepper motor. Oct. 21, 2020.

Here's the stepper motor board that comes in the Elegoo kit, with the motor itself behind.  This motor takes 2000 steps for one revolution.

![motor](unipolar_board.jpg)

Below is a photo of the connections to the Arduino.  The connections on the stepper board and the Arduino are listed:

- orange - in1 - Pin 8
- yellow - in2 - pin 9
- green - in3 - pin 10
- blue - in4 - pin 11
- red - power plus - VIN or 5V.  (with 9V battery as in the picture, VIN = 9 Volts)
- brown - power minus - ground

![arduino](unipolar_arduino.jpg)

Here is a link to a simple code that steps continuously.  [Unipolar_stepper.txt](Unipolar_stepper.txt)

Here is a code that uses a function to step, and steps forward and backwards.  [step_in_loop.txt](step_in_loop.txt)

Here is a code that uses tabs to make functions clearer, and does a small dance.  [unipolar_Oct21a.zip](unipolar_Oct21a.zip)

###Touch sensors.  Oct 21, 2020.

[link to page on touch sensing with Arduino](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/CapacitiveTouch/index.html)

###Combining code.

The linked code is what we tried to do in class:  move a motor an amnount depending on a sensor reading, only if the sensor reads greater than a programed value:  [touch-stepper.zip](touch-stepper.zip)


### DC Motors and driving them. Oct. 28, 2020.

![picture](motor_circuit.png)


Here's what we'll demonstrate in class:

 - motor and battery
 - using a transistor to turn a motor on and off.
 - Arduino code for on and off. Uses digitalWrite().
 - Arduino code for veriying speed by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), using  analogWrite().
 - Arduino code for touch-controlled speed.
