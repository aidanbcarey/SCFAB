###"PS70: Introduction to digital fabrication."

<b>Lab open house, including final projects from "How to Make (Almost) Anything", January 23, 2020 5PM - 8PM in Science Center 102.</b>

<b>First meeting: Tuesday, January 26, 2020 in Science Center 102.</b>

We are preparing to offer this course in  Spring 2020.  It will be an introduction to
tools of fabrication, including microcontrollers, circuits, computer controlled machines,
computer aided design, and hand tools.  This class will introduce you to the tools and practices of the
Science Center fabrication lab, and will give you an opportunity to participate in the community
that is continuing to grow around that space.  We intend for it to be accessible to those with no prior experience.
For students already familiar with some of the topics, it will be an opportunity to explore further.

In comparison to the MIT course, How to Make (almost) Anything, this course is less technical, more guided, less focussed on
circuitboard fabrication.  The two courses are similar in range of topics and the capabilities that they offer for projects.  For
some students, the MIT course may make sense as a follow-on to this one.
