###Notes on drawing machine.

July 15, 2020.  Made two-stepper drawing machine with parts from the kit.

- stepper motor responds to Serial command. [This sketch](./serial_step_setpoint1/serial_setpoint_1.txt)  accepts a target from serial data, and moves motor until step count reaches the target.  Can  put multiple numbers in the serial send.   Motor executes in order received.  
 - Uses while loop
 - code to accept ASCII input from computer:  [serial parser](./parse_serial)
 - target. Idea of setpoint.


- two steppers respond to ASCII characters.   [Here is the code](./serial_step_setpoint2.zip)
 - Serial buffer
 - array storage
 - use of tabs to clarify functions.


This can be used with spreadsheet data, for example, to plot functions.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t3upciMKFN9R7U9IX_7Lv_gCNRypH3CRqeuUtiKgamQ/edit?usp=sharing) is a spreadsheet, set up to calculate toolpaths for sets of x,y points.



###Files used along the way:

Here's a sketch to drive two steppers, one step at a time, with delays between steps.  Uses for loops.  This code makes a square with the setup above. [stepping two steppers](./two_steppers01)

Now add serial parsing and stepper code to make sketch that steps two motors N steps in response to ASCII command:[serial_steppers](./serial_steppers01)
