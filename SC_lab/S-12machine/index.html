###Notes on drawing machine.

July 15, 2020.  Made two-stepper drawing machine with parts from the kit.

[Drawing machine with two steppers, July 2020.](https://youtu.be/JjpYPcKUUpI)

Plan for class:

- stepper motor responds to I/O pin input.  Code to step one step each time the I/O pin rises.

- Machine concepts
 - Network
 - address
 - end effector


- servo example for one byte, on tinkercad.   Use to demo UART.  Demonstrate/talk about single byte and ASCII chars.  [tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2C1xWqjhOfL-powerful-borwo/editel?sharecode=-i_64yYC0v7TeIwGWku7Rxm_X6fyBYPSOyJV2EBF1CI)

- stepper motor responds to Serial command. [This sketch](./serial_step_setpoint1)  accepts a target from serial data, and moves motor until step count reaches the target.  Can  put multiple numbers in the serial send.   Motor executes in order received.  
 - Uses while loop
 - code to accept ASCII input from computer:  [serial parser](./parse_serial)
 - target. Idea of setpoint.


- two steppers respond to ASCII characters.   [Here is the code](./serial_step_setpoint2)
 - Serial buffer
 - array storage
 - use of tabs to clarify functions.
 

This can be used with spreadsheet data, for example, to plot functions.  I will try this soon.


[Copy of code currently in edit Friday 7/16/20 3;30 PM  ](./serial_step_setpoint3)

###Files used along the way:

Here's a sketch to drive two steppers, one step at a time, with delays between steps.  Uses for loops.  This code makes a square with the setup above. [stepping two steppers](./two_steppers01)

Now add serial parsing and stepper code to make sketch that steps two motors N steps in response to ASCII command:[serial_steppers](./serial_steppers01)
