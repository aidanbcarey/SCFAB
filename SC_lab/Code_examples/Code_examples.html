<li>Analog reads ten data points, stores the values in an array.  When button is pressed
Arduino sends the values through serial.  Values can be received by computer software.  One way is to use the Arduino serial monitor to receive
data and cut and paste into a spreadsheet.  Button is simply connected to digital pin 7 and to ground. The input pullup resistor is internal
to the microprocessor, and keeps the level HIGH until the button is pressed.</li>
  <li>This program stores data in RAM (data memory), of which there is 2kBytes in the Arduino.  This means that up to 1000 two-byte integers could be stored.
  Actually, since RAM is used for storage of other variables in your program, the space is more limited.  Also, RAM data disappears when
the device is reset or turned off.  For more permanent storage, use program memory or EEPROM memory.
Check the Arduino Reference for details.  See also this  <a href='https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/memories-of-an-arduino.pdf'>tutorial.</a>
